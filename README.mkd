# CS50 AI - Coursework Repository

This repository showcases my work from the **CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence** course.  
It contains implementations and projects covering various AI concepts, divided by class modules.

---

## Search

- **Degrees**: Implements a breadth-first search to determine the shortest path between two actors through their shared movies.  
- **Knight**: Solves the problem of finding the shortest path a knight can take on a chessboard using search algorithms.

## Knowledge

- **Minesweeper**: A logical AI agent that plays Minesweeper by inferring safe moves and mine locations.  
- **TicTacToe**: Implements an AI agent using the Minimax algorithm to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally.

---

## Uncertainty

- **PageRank**: Models and ranks nodes on a graph according to their relative importance, foundational for search engine algorithms and probabilistic reasoning.
- **Heredity**: Looks into probabilistic models for heredity/genetics, applying Bayesian inference and uncertain knowledge representation.

## Optimization

- **Crossword**: Uses constraint satisfaction and backtracking algorithms to fill crossword puzzles, demonstrating optimization and search in combinatorial spaces.

---

## Learning

- **Shopping**: A supervised learning project using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) applying machine learning techniques to consumer data.
- **Nim**: Implements a Q-learning agent to play the Nim game, utilizing reinforcement learning techniques like Q-value updates and epsilon-greedy action selection for game playing and policy learning.
